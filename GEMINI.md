# Directory Overview

This directory, `/home/malariaparasiet/Documents/coding`, is the root for various coding projects. It is a Git repository.

The user plans to work on projects in C, C++, Python, Java, and Rust. The directory may also be used for "hacking" related activities.

## Development Conventions

The user has requested a "learnfull tone". My primary role is to explain concepts and teach, rather than just providing code.

## Project Goals

The user has several long-term project goals:

*   **Operating System Development:** The ultimate goal is to create a custom operating system. This will involve creating small, interoperable modules, such as sorting algorithms and an echo program, as foundational building blocks.
*   **Embedded Systems and FPGAs:** The user is studying embedded engineering and plans to work on FPGA and embedded projects.
*   **Web-related Projects:** The user is interested in creating a web scraper and a chat interface.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** A future project involves reverse engineering an Android application to control an LED device.

## Building and Running

This is a multi-project directory, so build and run commands will be project-specific.

**TODO:** Add build and run instructions for individual projects as they are created.

## Key Files

*   `GEMINI.md`: This file, providing context for our interactions.

As projects are added, this section should be updated to list their key files.
